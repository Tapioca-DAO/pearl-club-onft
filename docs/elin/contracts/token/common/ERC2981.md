# ERC2981







*Implementation of the NFT Royalty Standard, a standardized way to retrieve royalty payment information. Royalty information can be specified globally for all token ids via {_setDefaultRoyalty}, and/or individually for specific token ids via {_setTokenRoyalty}. The latter takes precedence over the first. Royalty is specified as a fraction of sale price. {_feeDenominator} is overridable but defaults to 10000, meaning the fee is specified in basis points by default. IMPORTANT: ERC-2981 only specifies a way to signal royalty information and does not enforce its payment. See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981#optional-royalty-payments[Rationale] in the EIP. Marketplaces are expected to voluntarily pay royalties together with sales, but note that this standard is not yet widely supported. _Available since v4.5._*
